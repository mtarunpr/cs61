CS61 2020: Kernel 1
===================

Today’s lecture will introduce a version of the teaching kernel that
we will use for the kernel unit.

Advance work
------------

*Advance work should be completed before lecture, especially by active
listeners. There is nothing to turn in.*

Read [ABOUT.md](ABOUT.md) and run the kernel using `make run`. This
should work in our Docker container out of the box, but if you want to
run on a Linux VM or on Mac OS X, there will be some additional build
steps required.
