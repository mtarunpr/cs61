CS61 2020: Storage 4
====================

Todayâ€™s shorter meeting will consolidate our work this week.

Advance work
------------

*Advance work should be completed before lecture, especially by active
listeners. There is nothing to turn in.*

1\. Do the pre-work for previous lectures, and the [activity for
storage3](https://cs61.seas.harvard.edu/site/2020/Storage3Activity).

2\. The usual standard I/O cache works well for some workloads, and poorly for
others. Describe a *read-only* workload for which you expect the standard I/O
cache to work poorly.

3\. How would you change the standard I/O cache to work better on this
workload?
