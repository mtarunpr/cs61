CS61 2020: Assembly 3
=====================

Todayâ€™s lecture/section goes over assembly puzzles, using GDB, and conditional
branching.

Advance work
------------

*Advance work should be completed before lecture, especially by active
listeners. There is nothing to turn in.*

Read the [lecture activity
notes](https://cs61.seas.harvard.edu/site/2020/Asm3Activity/) and follow the
instructions. Solve `fun01` on your own (the lecture activity notes describe
how). Then try to solve `fun02` and `fun02.s` (trying to figure out what
arguments are fun from the assembly; `src/fun02.cc` is present if you get
stuck).
