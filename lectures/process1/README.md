CS61 2020: Process control 1
============================

Todayâ€™s meeting initiates our process control unit.

Advance work
------------

*Advance work should be completed before lecture, especially by active
listeners. There is nothing to turn in.*

1\. Read `fork1.cc`, then `make` and run `./fork1` several times.
Which process prints first? Is this true every time?

2\. Read `fork2.cc`, then run `./fork2`. The resulting processes
should print four lines in total. Explain why.

3\. Can you figure out a way to run `./fork2` so that the resulting
processes print *more* than four lines in total?
