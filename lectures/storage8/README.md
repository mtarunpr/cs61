CS61 2020: Storage 8 (EthiCS)
=============================

Todayâ€™s meeting is our Embedded EthiCS meeting. It explores issues of equality
through the lens of data representation, and specifically the representation
of human language in computer-readable form.

Advance work
------------

*Advance work should be completed before lecture, especially by active
listeners. There is nothing to turn in.*

Zach has prepared pre-reading on equality in
philosophy.

As you read this, please think about this question: What is one source of
inequality (i.e. a way in which inequalities in society can come about) that
is typically or always an unjust source of inequality? What is one source of
inequality that is typically *not* an unjust source of inequality?

We also have prepared some material on character representation and Unicode.
You can look at the slides yourself, and/or watch my presentation of the
material.
