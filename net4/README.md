CS61 2020: Networking 4
============================

Todayâ€™s meeting is about synchronization

Advance work
------------

*Advance work should be completed before lecture, especially by active
listeners. There is nothing to turn in.*

Review what we did at the end of networking 3.

Check out the output of `./incr-basic` and `./incr-basic-O0` when you
run each program multiple times

Inspect their assembly code and think about how threads execute the
code that result in the output you see.
