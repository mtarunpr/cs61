Kernel question
===============
Suppose that a certain virtual address on BigsyOS, 0x295e41, maps to the physical address 0x123XYZ.

(a) What is XYZ? Briefly explain.

(b) What are the L1, L2, L3, and L4 page table indices of this virtual address? Assume that L4 refers to the highest-level page table (whose address is stored in `%cr3`).

(c) Assume that BigsyOS has 0x30000000 bytes of virtual memory and uses a **single-level page table** (i.e., a rudimentary page table implemented as a simple mapping array). If a total of 1024 non-page table pages have been allocated (virtual addresses 0x0 to 0x400000), how much space would the page table use up?

(d) Now assume that BigsyOS instead uses a **multi-level page table** with 4 levels. If a total of 1024 non-page table pages have been allocated (virtual addresses 0x0 to 0x400000), how much space would the page table use up?
