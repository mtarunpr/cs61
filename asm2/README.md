CS61 2020: Assembly 2
=====================

We continue our journey into machine code today.

Advance work
------------

*Advance work should be completed before lecture, especially by active
listeners. There is nothing to turn in.*

1\. The function defined in `src/f14.cc` performs an array access. Examine
`f14.s`. Given this, what source files do you think produced `f15.s`? How
about `f16.s`?

2\. The function defined in `src/f17.cc` performs some pointer arithmetic.
Examine `f17.s`. How does this differ from `f14.s`? Given this, how do you
think the new instruction behaves? Is there another set of instructions that
would be equivalent?

3\. The function defined in `src/f19.cc` can be used to infer how local
variables and function parameters are handled. Compare it with `f19.s` and
develop a theory of argument passing.
