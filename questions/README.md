CS61 2020: Review questions
===========================

This repository is for submitting your review questions. There is a
subdirectory for each unit of the course. We are going to ask for **one**
review question per unit.

Students **must not collaborate** on the review questions they create.
Students should create questions on their own. Each question should represent
the student’s own work—no copying a question from the Internet or posting
questions to the Internet, although the usual resources (book, notes, course
videos, prior course material, general Internet research) may be used in the
process of creating a question. Staff can help students evaluate whether a
review question is too close to material available in the book or on the web.

How to write a question
-----------------------

Please base your questions on our exercises. Links:

1. [Data representation](https://cs61.seas.harvard.edu/site/2020/DatarepEx)
2. [Assembly](https://cs61.seas.harvard.edu/site/2020/AsmEx)
3. [Kernel](https://cs61.seas.harvard.edu/site/2020/KernelEx)
4. [Storage](https://cs61.seas.harvard.edu/site/2020/StorageEx)
5. [Shell and process control](https://cs61.seas.harvard.edu/site/2020/ShellEx)
6. [Synchronization](https://cs61.seas.harvard.edu/site/2020/SynchEx) and [networking](https://cs61.seas.harvard.edu/site/2020/NetworkingEx)

You should write up both a question, stored in `DIRECTORY/q1.md`, and a
solution, stored in `DIRECTORY/q1sol.md`. We prefer questions and solutions be
written in Markdown or plaintext. If images are required, that’s OK; you can
link to them from Markdown, or, if necessary, add a PDF or Word document to
the directory.

Grading
-------

Course staff will grade your review questions for relevance to the class
material, creativity, and the existence of an unambiguous answer that is
correctly described.

It should take a few hours to invent a question. A question that takes 10
minutes to write, and that a TF could complete in 1 minute, is too short.

Among our review questions for the data representation unit, the following
questions are on the short side. If you create a question of similar length,
we may ask you to add an additional part.

* [DATAREP-4](https://cs61.seas.harvard.edu/site/2020/DatarepEx#datarep-4)
* [DATAREP-6](https://cs61.seas.harvard.edu/site/2020/DatarepEx#datarep-6)
* [DATAREP-14](https://cs61.seas.harvard.edu/site/2020/DatarepEx#datarep-14)
* [DATAREP-17](https://cs61.seas.harvard.edu/site/2020/DatarepEx#datarep-17)

The following questions are longer than we are expecting (it took us many
hours to create them, but if you create a similar question, we will be
excited):

* [DATAREP-5](https://cs61.seas.harvard.edu/site/2020/DatarepEx#datarep-5)
* [DATAREP-21](https://cs61.seas.harvard.edu/site/2020/DatarepEx#datarep-21)
* [DATAREP-22](https://cs61.seas.harvard.edu/site/2020/DatarepEx#datarep-22)

If you prefer short questions, that’s cool. Create a multi-part question with
independent parts, or add additional questions in files like `q2.md` and so
forth.
